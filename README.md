# Advent of Code 2022!
Hello Everyone! This is my second year with Advent of code and for a second time I'm programming in Rust.  Hopefully it will go smoother than last time!

### Overall Features and Goals
- launches from the command line and takes arguments for the day and an input file.  Calculates the two results.
- Using the Clap crate this year for command line processing.
- Going to implement tests for the daily challenges with the provided test input and output as test validation.

### Day 0 (T minus 1)
- Got the Git repository set up and prepared some input/output functions and command line processing.  Added nearly automatic unit tests with macro rules to write the body of the test functions.  Much code borrowed from last year, but a much better setup than 2021.

### Day 1
#### Approach and Unique features
- It's begun!  First day complete!
- Nothing too special in this code.  Used vectors to store data.  Decided not to sort and select the top 3 for the second challenge, but used comparisons to select the top 3. Sorting would have been an option for less code (probably just 2-3 lines) but much more processor intensive.  I'll be using that in later days I'm sure.

### Day 2

- Challenge 1 complete.  Check back for updates.
